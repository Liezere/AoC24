# Advent of Code 2024

This year I have decided to use [AoC 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) to learn Prolog. 
I'll be using [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/) because it is open, mature and available everywhere.

If you want to execute the code just install SWI-Prolog using your package manager and run the task using shell piping in your input data like this:
```
cat data.txt | ./day01.pl
```
